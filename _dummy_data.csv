13/06/2025 01:51:45,,"It was hard to concentrate because the instructions panel was big, almost on the whole screen and it was hard to focus on the points of the map. I still don't know if the colors on the map where supposed to guide me and offer help, it was kinda confusing cause i initially thought they guided me, but then i saw the patterns are similar on different routes so I think that its just the design. Make the scale smaller, or maybe its intentionally like this so its more difficult to finish in a decent time. Also, when i entered the page I didn't know what to do at first so I just clicked on the first image thinking this is how i start the game, but then i remembered you said to put 15-20 and i found it at the footer of the page, so maybe make it more intuitive for tired people like me. It was a breath of fresh air and for someone who was never curious about this field, thank you! you're doing something great! good luck",4347171749768335
